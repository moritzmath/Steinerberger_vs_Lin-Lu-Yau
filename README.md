# Comparison between the Steinerbeger and the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature 

We compare the Steinerberger curvature and the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature on various types of random graphs. We investigate graphs on which the two notions of discrete curvature agree or differ, and analyze their behavior across different graph structures.
